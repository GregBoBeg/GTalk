          <h3 class="page-h3">The Application</h3>
          <p>
            GTalk is a chat application developed in vanilla Javascript, 
            which uses Node.js, Express and Socket.IO for backend communication between users. 
          </p>

          <h4 class="page-h4">Front-end Functionality</h4>
          <p>
            The Welcome Pageâ€™s primary function is to allow users a choice of which chat discussion they wish to join.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a discussion topic is selected, the user is added to the discussion, where they can chat with other users about that topic.
          </p>

          <h4 class="page-h4">Back-end Functionality</h4>
          <p>
            The Node.js server-side code emits signals when users join and leave discussions.  
            When a signal is detected, the user is added to (or removed from) the socket.  
            A message is then broadcasted back out over the socket, notifying all other users that someone has joined/left the discussion. 
          </p>
          <p>
            When a user posts a message, the server-side code detects the message and broadcasts it back out over the socket 
            to all other users in that discussion, thus facilitating real-time chat.
          </p>

          <h3 class="page-h3">The Deployment</h3>
          <p>
            The GTalk app is deployed on the Heroku platform.  
            The project is maintained with version control, using GIT, and pushed to a Github repository. 
            Heroku is configured with a pipeline to automatically recognize and deploy changes from the Github repository.
          </p>

          <h3 class="page-h3">Using and Test-Driving GTalk</h3>
          <p>To test drive the app's functionality, open multiple copies of the app's <a href="index.html" class="page-link" target="_blank">Welcome Page</a> (index.html).  
            This can be done on multiple devices or on a single device with multple browser windows.
          </p>
          <p>
            On each Welcome Page, enter a unique Username for each window.  
            Also, be sure to select the <b>same discussion topic</b> on each Welcome Page.  
            This will allow real-time chatting between each browser window.
          </p>
